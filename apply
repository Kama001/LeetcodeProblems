Why SUSE - Since I have started using linux in my career I'm really impressed how easy it is to automate things using linux compared to windows. When it comes to SUSE it is one of the best flavours of Linux and pioneer in open source contribution, it excites me to work with SUSE to learn how things work in the background that makes developers life easier. I hope my skills and experience make me a good fit for this role.

Why do think this is the right role - I have the skill set that matches the job description and I have great interest towards open source contribution and I'm self motivated and passionate about learning new technologies and constantly applying things I've learned.
